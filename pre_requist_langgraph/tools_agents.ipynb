It needs to specify:\n    * **Which teams** are being compared? \n    * **Over what period?**  IPL history spans many years.\n\n**Possible follow-up questions:**\n\n1. **\"Which two IPL teams are you comparing?\"**  For example: \"Who won more IPL trophies, Mumbai Indians or Chennai Super Kings?\" \n2. **\"Are you asking about IPL wins in the entire history of the tournament, or in a specific year or range of years?\"**\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to refine the question and I can help you find the answer! \n\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",
